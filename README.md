# MARLMS
The Matlab code is complete, the Python code is still being updated and will be open sourced soon.
In this work, the intelligent behavior priority switching problems of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) are studied. A reliable intelligent mission supervisor (IMS) is proposed to dynamically determine the behavior priorities. Specifically, the paradigm of null-space-based behavioral control with nonholonomic constraints (NSBC-NCs) is given to generate the reference commands that satisfy the NCs. Then, a multi-agent reinforcement learning mission supervisor (MARLMS) is developed to learn the optimal joint behavior priority policy. Particularly, the reliance on artificial switching rules is significantly reduced by using the learning systems. Finally, a model predictive control redundancy replanner (MPCRR) is designed to improve the reliability of the learned joint priority policy by establishing an rolling optimization problem with safety constraints. Simulation and experiment results show that switching frequency and iteration times are reduced compared to existing mission supervisors. Moreover, both nonholonomic and safety constraints are not violated theoretically.
